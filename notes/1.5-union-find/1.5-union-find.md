## 1.5 Case Study: Union-Find

----

### Dynamic Connectivity Problem
Given a set of *N* objects (refered to as **sites**), with pairs (refered to as **connections**) accessible via the `Union` command, and equivalence classes referring to **connected components**, construct the following API that can determine if two objects are connected by a path.

```
class UF
  initialize(N): // Initialize N sites with integer names (0 to N-1)
  union(p, q): // Add a connection between p and q
  find(p) // Component identifier for p (0 to N-1)
  connected(p, q): // Return true if p and q are in the same component
  count(): // Number of components
```

#### Building a Test Client
The dynamic connectivity client should read in number of objects *N* from standard input, repeatedly read in pairs of integers and if they are not connected, connect them and print out the pair of integers.

#### Quick-Find Algorithm
Maintain the invariant that *p* and *q* are connected if and only if `id[p]` is equal to `id[q]`. In other words, all sites in a component must have the same value in `id[]`. `find(p)` just returns `id[p]`, which immediately implies that `connected(p, q)` reduces to just the test `id[p] === id[q]` and returns `true` if and only if *p* and *q* are in the same component. To maintain the invariant for the call `union(p, q)`, if they are not in the same component, we combine the two components into one, i.e. change all the `id[]` entries in one site to the value in all the other site.  

Analysis: Suppose we wind up with a single component, this requires `N-1` calls to `union()` and at least `N+3` array accesses for each call to `union()` when combining the two components. This leads to a quadratic-time process.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

class QuickFind {
  constructor() {
    this.numComponents = null;
    this.id = [];
  }

  initialize(filePath) {
    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      if (err !== null) { console.log(err); }
      let parsedData  = data.split('\n');
      this.numComponents = Number(parsedData[0]);

      for (let i = 0; i < this.numComponents; i++) {
        // Set id of each object to itself
        this.id.push(i);
      }

      // Read the input and create dynamic connections
      for (let j = 1; j < parsedData.length - 1; j++) {
        let p = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[0]);
        let q = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[1]);

        if (!this.connected(p, q)) { // Ignore connected components
          this.union(p, q); // Combine unconnected components
          console.log(`Joined ${p} and ${q}`);
        }
      }

      console.log(`Number of components: ${this.count()}`);
    });
  }

  union(p, q) {
    // Put p and q into the same component
    let pID = this.find(p);
    let qID = this.find(q);

    if (pID !== qID) {
      this.numComponents--;
      // Change all values from id[p] to id[q] iff they're not already the same
      for (let i = 0; i < this.id.length; i++) {
        if (this.id[i] === pID) {
          this.id[i] = qID;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  find(p) {
    return this.id[p];
  }

  connected(p, q) {
    return this.id[p] === this.id[q];
  }

  count() {
    return this.numComponents;
  }
}

const qf = new QuickFind();
qf.initialize('../../input/union-find/tinyUF.txt');

```

#### Quick Union
A lazy approach to speed up the `union()` operation. Each `id` entry of a component is now the parent node in a forest of trees. We follow the links of a site until we have a site that refers to itself (i.e. index and value are the same), this site is a **root**. Two sites are in the same component if and only if this process leads them to the same root. `union(p, q)` needs to maintain this invariant simply by renaming one (rather than all) of the `id` entries in any connection of two sites.  

Analysis: An improvement over quick-find because it removes a major liability - that `union()` always takes linear time. However, the number of array accesses used by `find()` is *2d +1* where *d* is the depth of the node corresponding to the given site. This means that the running time is still quadratic in the worst case (where the trees are incredibly unbalanced).

```js
const fs = require('fs');

class QuickUnion {
  constructor() {
    this.numComponents = null;
    this.id = [];
  }

  initialize(filePath) {
    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      if (err !== null) { console.log(err); }
      let parsedData  = data.split('\n');
      this.numComponents = Number(parsedData[0]);

      for (let i = 0; i < this.numComponents; i++) {
        // Set id of each object to itself
        this.id.push(i);
      }

      // Read the input and create dynamic connections
      for (let j = 1; j < parsedData.length - 1; j++) {
        let p = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[0]);
        let q = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[1]);

        if (!this.connected(p, q)) { // Ignore connected components
          this.union(p, q); // Combine unconnected components
          console.log(`Joined ${p} and ${q}`);
        }
      }

      console.log(`Number of components: ${this.count()}`);
    });
  }

  union(p, q) {
    // Put p and q into the same component
    let pRoot = this.root(p);
    let qRoot = this.root(q);

    if (pRoot !== qRoot) {
      // Give p and q the same root if they did not already have the same root
      this.id[pRoot] = qRoot;
      this.numComponents--;
    }
  }

  root(i) {
    // Chase parent pointers until the root is reached
    while (i !== this.id[i]) { i = this.id[i]; }
    return i;
  }

  connected(p, q) {
    // Check if p and q have the same root
    return this.root(p) === this.root(q);
  }

  count() {
    return this.numComponents;
  }
}

const qu = new QuickUnion();
qu.initialize('../../input/union-find/tinyUF.txt');

```

#### Weighted Quick-Union
To prevent trees from growing to an extremely large size, rather than arbitrarily connecting the second tree to the first for `union()`, we can keep track of the **size** of each tree and always connect the smaller tree to the larger.  

Analysis: Trees have a simple property that the height of a tree of *2^n* nodes is *n*. When we merge two trees of *2^n* nodes, we get a tree of *2^(n+1)* nodes, and we increase the height of the tree to *n + 1*. This allows us to prove that a weighted algorithm can guarantee **logarithmic** performance. The end result is that the depth of any node in a forest built by weighted quick-union for *N* sites is at most *lg N*. The increased *flatness* of the tree structure means that the average depth of a forest is a lot lower those generated by the Quick Union algorithm.

#### Weighted Quick-Union with Path Compression
We can just add another loop to `find()` that sets the `id[]` entry corresponding to each node encountered along the way to link directly to the root. The net result is to flatten the trees almost completely, approximating the ideal achieved by the quick-find algorithm.  

Analysis: WQUWPC is optimal and allows almost constant-time efficiency. The simpler one-path variant makes every other node in path point to its grandparent, thereby halving path length. The two-pass implementation adds a second loop to `root()` to set the `id[]` of each examined node to the root.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

class WeightedQuickUnion {
  constructor() {
    this.numComponents = null;
    this.id = [];
    this.size = [];
  }

  initialize(filePath) {
    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      if (err !== null) { console.log(err); }
      let parsedData  = data.split('\n');
      this.numComponents = Number(parsedData[0]);

      for (let i = 0; i < this.numComponents; i++) {
        // Set id of each object to itself
        this.id.push(i);
        // Instantiate the size of each component as 1
        this.size.push(1);
      }

      // Read the input and create dynamic connections
      for (let j = 1; j < parsedData.length - 1; j++) {
        let p = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[0]);
        let q = Number(parsedData[j].split(' ')[1]);

        if (!this.connected(p, q)) { // Ignore connected components
          this.union(p, q); // Combine unconnected components
          console.log(`Joined ${p} and ${q}`);
        }
      }

      console.log(`Number of components: ${this.count()}`);
    });
  }

  union(p, q) {
    // Put p and q into the same component
    let pRoot = this.root(p);
    let qRoot = this.root(q);

    if (pRoot !== qRoot) {
      // Give p and q the same root if they did not already have the same root
      if (this.size[pRoot] < this.size[qRoot]) {
        // Make the smaller root point to the larger one, and increase its size
        this.id[pRoot] = qRoot;
        this.size[pRoot] += this.size[qRoot];
      } else {
        this.id[qRoot] = pRoot;
        this.size[qRoot] += this.size[pRoot];
      }

      this.numComponents--;
    }
  }

  root(i) {
    // Chase parent pointers until the root is reached
    while (i !== this.id[i]) {
      while (this.id[i] !== this.id[this.id[i]]) {
        // Two-pass implementation of path compression, pointing to the root
        this.id[i] = this.id[this.id[i]];
      }
      i = this.id[i];
    }

    return i;
  }

  connected(p, q) {
    // Check if p and q have the same root
    return this.root(p) === this.root(q);
  }

  count() {
    return this.numComponents;
  }
}

const wqu = new WeightedQuickUnion();
wqu.initialize('../../input/union-find/tinyUF.txt');
