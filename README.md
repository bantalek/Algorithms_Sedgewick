# Algorithms, 4th edition
A collection of notes and solutions created for Algorithms, 4th ed. by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

## Running the Code
The output for all code can be run with the newest version of node (tested on `v6.9.3`), which supports ES2015 syntax.
For older versions, transpilation using a `Babel` watcher or using `babel-node` is required. To run the code, simply 
execute `node [filename]` in the `/src` directory.

## Using the Notes
The notes were written for personal benefit and reference and were intended neither as a substitute for the book nor a comprehensive reference. They are included here for completeness and can be accessed through the `/notes` directory or via the Table of Contents.
